Investigation Title	Off-line high pH reversed-phase fractionation for in-depth phosphoproteomics
Experiment Description	In this study we provide a detailed analysis of the physicochemical characteristics of phosphopeptides, which have been fractionated by off-line high pH chromatography (HpH) before subsequent titanium dioxide (TiO2) enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis. Our results demonstrate that HpH is superior to standard strong-cation exchange (SCX) fractionation in total number of phosphopeptides detected when analyzing the same number of fractions by identical 70 minutes LC-MS/MS gradients

Protocol Description	NIH/3T3 cells were lysed using RIPA buffer and protein lysates digested with Lys-C and Trypsin. Peptides were then desalted on a C18 Sep-Pak catridge. Peptides were fractionated using strong cation exchange and high pH reveresed-phase fractionation for a total of 14 fractions each. Each fraction was enriched using titanium dioxide metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC). All samples were analyzed using Thermo Fisher Q-Exactive Orbitrap or Q-Exactive Orbitrap Plus mass spectrometer coupled to a Easy-nLC 1000 liquid chromatography system using a data dependent aquisition methods.	MaxQuant 1.4.1.4 with Andromeda search engine was used to analyze all LC/MS/MS data. HCD spectra was search against an in-silico tryptic digest of mus musculus proteins from the Uniprot sequence database (v. april 2014). For phosphopeptide identification, variable modifications such as acetyl (protein n-term, methionine oxidation, phosphorylation (STY), glutamine cyclization to pyroglutamate was used. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, maxium 3 missed cleavages were allowed. MS1 precursors were matched to 4.5 ppm tolerance, 20 ppm for fragment spectra. All PSM were filtered to 1% FDR, modified peptides required length of 7 and Andromeda score of 40 to be considered a positive hit.
