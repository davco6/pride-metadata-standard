Investigation Title	Proteomics study of skin tissues from RDEB cSCC, low-risk cSCC and metastasizing cSCC
Experiment Description	Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the leading cause of death in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) patients but remains poorly studied on a proteomic level. We aim to characterize the RDEB-SCC proteome by comparing it to the proteomes of UV-light induced cSCC of non-aggressive and aggressive behavior with which RDEB cSCC share either the well-differentiated morphology or the aggressive behavior, respectively. We applied a direct trypsinization protocol using an acid labile surfactant and label-free quantitation to study formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from patients with RDEB cSCC (n=6), low-risk cSCC (n=5) and metastasizing cSCC (n=13) by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry.

Protocol Description	One or two 10 µm FFPE cSCC tissue slices per patient were prepared for mass spectrometry analysis with a direct trypsinization protocol using the acid labile surfactant RapiGest. FFPE tissues were deparaffinized and boiled in 100 µl of an aqueous buffer containing 0.1 % RapiGest SF (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), 0.1 M HEPES pH 8 (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) for 4 hours at 95°C and 750 rpm for heat induced antigen retrieval and protein extraction. Sequencing grade trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) was added in ratio of at least 2 µg per mm3 tissue and proteins were digested overnight at 37°C. Afterwards the samples were centrifuged at 19000 g for 15 min to remove remaining cell debris. The peptide concentration in the supernatant was estimate with the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA). The remaining supernatant was treated with 10 mM DTT for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by 30 mM iodacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) for 15 min at 37 °C and again 10 mM DTT for 15 min at 37 °C to reduce and alkylate the cysteine residues of the peptides. Then the samples were brought to a final concentration of 3M guanidinium chloride (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), acidified (pH < 3) with hydrochloric acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to destroy RapiGest. Centrifugation at 19000 g for 10 min was performed to remove any precipitate. 15 µg of peptides per sample were desalted using self-packed C18 STAGE tips (Empore, St. Paul, MN, USA). BCA assay was performed and 3 µg peptides per sample were vacuum dried in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and stored at -80 °C until measured by LC-MS/MS. Each sample was dissolved in 40 µl aqueous buffer containing 2 % acetonitrile and 0.3 % acetic acid. 5 µl of the sonicated sample were analyzed by an Orbitrap Q-Exactive plus (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer coupled to an Easy nanoLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific) with a flow rate of 300 nl/min . Buffer A (0.3 % (v/v) acetic acid) and buffer B (B 0.3 % (v/v) acetic acid in 80 % acetonitrile) were applied with an increasing gradient of acetonitrile over time (0 – 60 % (v/v) acetonitrile in 100 min). This gradient serves to separate the peptides by their hydrophobicity on the analytical column (Acclaim PepMap column (Thermo Scientific)), 2 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size, length 150 mm, inner diameter 50 µm). The mass spectrometer analyzed the mass range from 300 to 2000 Dalton in a data dependent mode and with a top10 method, so that each MS scan is followed by a maximum of ten MS/MS scans.	Proteomics data analysis was performed with the MaxQuant (V1.5.2.8) software. Peptides were identified with the implemented Andromeda search engine using the reviewed human database without isotopes downloaded from Uniprot on 15th April 2016 (20193 entries). The revert function was used to generate decoys for the database search. The false discovery rate for peptides and proteins was set to 1%. The initial search was performed with 20 ppm precursor mass tolerance. For the main search it was set to 4.5 ppm and the fragment mass tolerance to 20 ppm. Two missed cleavages were tolerated for the tryptic cleavage specifity. A minimal peptide length of seven amino acids was required. The only fixed modification was Carbamidodimethyl at cysteines. Label-free quantitation (LFQ) on at least one peptide per protein was done using the MaxLFQ algorithm.  A second analysis was performed in order to identify mutated peptides. Therefore, an analogous MaxQuant analysis was performed with the only difference that the search was performed against the XMan mutated-peptide database (Yang and Lazar 2014), which was appended to the uniprot database used for the main analysis.
