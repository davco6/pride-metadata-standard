Protocol Description	A yeast cell lysate was prepared in 8M urea / 0.1M ammonium bicarbonate buffer and this lysate was used to resuspend and perform a serial dilution of the UPS1 standard mixture (Sigma). Twenty µL of each of the resulting samples, corresponding to 10 different spiked levels of UPS1 (respectively 0,01 - 0,05 - 0,100 - 0,250 - 0,5 - 1 - 5 - 10 - 25 - 50 fmol of UPS1 /µg of yeast lysate), were reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. The urea concentration was lowered to 1M by dilution, and proteins were digested in solution by addition of 2% of trypsin overnight. Enzymatic digestion was stopped by addition of TFA (0.5% final concentration). Samples (1µg of yeast cell lysate + different spiked level of UPS1) were analyzed in quadruplicate by nanoLC-MS/MS using a nanoRS UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a QExactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) using a top20 data-dependent acquisition method.	MS/MS data were searched in a yeast database from UniprotKB (S_cerevisiae_ 20160915.fasta, 6729 sequences) , a compiled database containing the UPS1 human sequences (48 sequences) and a common contaminants database. Peaklists were generated using Proline and were submitted to database search with Mascot (version 2.5.1). ESI-FTMS-HCD was chosen as the instrument, trypsin/P as the enzyme and 1 missed cleavage was allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set at 5 ppm and 70mmu, respectively. Peptide variable modifications allowed during the search were: acetyl (Protein N-ter), oxidation (M), whereas carbamidomethyl (C) was set as fixed modification. Proline was used to validate peptides and protein sets. Proline quantify peptides proteins based on MS trace.
