Investigation Title	Individual variability of protein expression in human tissues
Experiment Description	A retrospective analysis of proteomics data from nine different human tissues, to understand the inter-individual and inter-tissue variability in protein expression. We used the data to build robust classifiers to predict the tissue of origin.
