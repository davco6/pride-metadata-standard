MAGE-TAB Version	1.1
Investigation Title	Arabidopsis proteomic tissue atlas
Experiment Description	Qualitative and quantitative atlas of the transcriptomes, proteomes and phosphoproteomes of 30 tissues of the model plant Arabidopsis. We describe how many genes were detected as proteins (>18,000), where they are expressed, in which approximate quantities (>6 logs dynamic range) and to what extent they are post-translationally modified by phosphorylation (>43,000 sites). We also measured protein complexes in three tissues (flower, root, leaf) using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-MS) and the seed proteome in response to cycloheximide and MG132 treatment.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Columbia-0) plants were grown on soil, plates or in liquid culture depending on tissue type. Tissue samples were homogenized and digested with Trypsin. For the tissue atlas, protein digests (1 mg) for all 30 tissue types were divided into full proteome and phosphoproteome samples using IMAC enrichment and further off-line fractionated (full proteome: 24 fractions, hydrophilic strong anion exchange chromatography; phosphoproteome: 4 fractions, basic reversed-phase chromatography). For protein complex analysis, native size-exclusion chromatography was performed with 1 mg of protein input for three selected tissues (leaf, flower, root) on a Superose 6 10/30 GL column and 80 consecutive fractions were collected. For the chase experiment seeds were treated with cycloheximide or MG132 for 8h, 16h and 24h. Samples were offline-fractionated using basic reversed-phase chromatography (48 fractions). All measurements were performed in DDA mode on a Q Exactive HF.	Protein identification and quantification was performed using MaxQuant (1.5.8.3). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the Arabidopsis thaliana reference proteome (Araport11; www.araport.org) supplemented with common contaminants and a library of phospho or retention time spike-in peptides. For short open reading frame (sORF) identification full proteome MS/MS spectra were searched against sORF (ARA-PEP, ATSO) databases in combination with Araport11.
