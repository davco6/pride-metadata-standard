Protocol Description	For the creation of the mouse dataset cultured cells of a murine myoblast cell line were harvested and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 x g. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (3 mM Tris-HCl, 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, pH 8.5), homogenized and lysed via sonification (6 times for 10 sec, on ice). After centrifugation (15 min, 16,000 x g) the supernatant was collected and protein content was determined by Bradford protein assay. For the following tryptic in-solution digestion 20 µg of sample was diluted in 50 mM ammoniumbicarbonate (pH 7.8) to a final volume of 100 µl, reduced by adding DTT and alkylated with iodacetamide as described previously in 37. After digestion the peptide concentration was determined by aminoacid analysis and 200 ng of the peptide sample was subsequently analyzed by a label-free mass spectrometry approach using an UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano LC system directly coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (both Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany).	For spectrum identification an mzML file was created from a Thermo RAW file using the msConvertGUI of ProteoWizard38 and further converted into an MGF file by OpenMS. This MGF was searched against a decoy database of the Mouse Complete Proteome Set downloaded from UniProtKB on 26.11.2014 (44,467 entries). A shuffled decoy database was created with the DecoyDatabaseBuilder39. The search engines used a parent mass tolerance of 5 ppm, fragment mass tolerance of 0.4 Da and allowed one missed cleavage. Oxidation of M, acetylation of the protein N-terminus, Glu to pyro-Glu and Gln to pyro-Glu were used as variable modifications, carbamidomethylation of C as fixed modification.
