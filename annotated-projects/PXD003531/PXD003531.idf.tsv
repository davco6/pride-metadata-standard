Investigation Title	Proteomics of Primary cells derived from Ovarian Cancer
Experiment Description	We analyzed primary cells derived from patients with ovarian cancer. We compared OSE, FTE and EOC and we use quantitative propeomics followed by WB, IHC, TMA for validation of our findings. We also analyzed the phosphoproteome of OVCAR3.

Date of Experiment	2016-01-27

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD003531	P-MTAB-Data-PXD003531
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	We started form 700 ug of proteins, enriched (or not) for phophorylated peptides by TiO2-based chromatography, and analyzed the peptide mixture on QExactive and QExavtive-HF from Thermofisher.	We used MaxQuant, Perseus, and the Bioconductor pachkage LIMNA in R for data analysis.
