Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD005463	P-MTAB-Data-PXD005463
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	Yeast were grown on SILAC media (heavy Arg10, Lys8 / light. Mitochondria were purified according to Sickmann et al, PNAS 2003. Highly purified mitochondria (heavy and light). Outer mitochondrial membrane vesicles (OMV) were isolated by osmotic swelling, followed by two ultracentrifugation steps (Zahedi et al, Mol Biol Cell 2006). Total membranes were isolated by sonication followed by ultracentrifugation. Light/Heavy OMV and total membranes were mixed in three different ratios, and OMV/Total ratios were determined based on SILAC ratios. Therefore, samples were analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS on a Q-Exactive Plus.	SILAC samples were individually analyzed using MaxQuant and the SGD database, generating 3 quantitative datasets which were used to determine protein distributions between total and outer mitochondrial membranes.
