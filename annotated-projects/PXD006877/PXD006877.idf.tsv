Investigation Title	Haloferax volcanii SILAC study of Oxidative stress
Experiment Description	SILAC was used to monitor proteome changes to Haloferax volcanii after treatment with oxidizing agent NaOCl. SILAC amino acids used were Lysine(+8) and Arginine(+6).  For treatment and control groups 4 replicates were used. In replicates 1 and 3, the control group had supplementation of both light lysine and argninie to the medium and the treatment group was supplemented with both heavy lysine(+8) and arginine(+6). In replicates 2 and 4, the labeling was switched, with the control containing heavy lysine(+8) and arginine(+6) and the treatement was supplemented with light lysine and arginine.  After treatment, cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio (control:treatment) and proteins were extracted and digested with trypsin.   For the incorporation test, cells were grown in meduim containing heavy lysine(+8) and argnine(+6) and allowed to grow for 24 hours, then subcultured twice, sequentially after 24 h of growth. To test for incorporation of the heavy amino acids, cells were harvested, proteins extracted, and digested with trypsin.

Protocol Description	For the oxidative stress study, proteins were treated with MMTS, digested with trypsin, and separated by SCX into 14 fractions. Each fration (and post-run fractions) was analysed by LC-MS/MS (Thermo Easy-nLC coupled to a Thermo Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer).   For the incorporation study, proteins were treated with iodoacetamide, digested with trypsin, and analysed by 60 min gradient on Thermo Easy-nLC coupled to a Thermo Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer.	For the oxidative stress study, using Proteome Discoverer 2.1, 2 missed cleavages by trypsin were allowed, static modification of Methylthio on cysteine, dynamic modifications of lysine(+8), arginine(+6), proline (+5), methionine oxidation, N-term acetylation, lysine (digly), FDR cutoff for protein and peptide identification of 1% and q-value of 0.01.    For the incorporation test, using Proteome Discoverer 2.1, 2 missed cleavages by trypsin were allowed, static modification of Carbamidomethyl on cysteine, dynamic modifications of lysine(+8), arginine(+6), proline (+5), methionine oxidation, N-term acetylation, lysine (digly), FDR cutoff for protein and peptide identification of 1% and q-value of 0.01.
