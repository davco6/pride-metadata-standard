Investigation Title	ProteomeTools -  Building ProteomeTools based on a complete synthetic human proteome
Experiment Description	The ProteomeTools project aims to derive molecular and digital tools from the human proteome to facilitate biomedical and life science research. Here, we describe the generation and multimodal LC-MS/MS analysis of >350,000 synthetic tryptic peptides representing nearly all canonical human gene products. This resource will be extended to 1.4 million peptides within two years and all data will be made available to the public in ProteomicsDB.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD004732	P-MTAB-Data-PXD004732
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	Tryptic peptides were individually synthesized by solid phase synthesis, combined into pools of ~1,000 peptides and measured on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. For each peptide pool, an inclusion list was generated to target peptides for fragmentation in further LC-MS experiments using five fragmentation methods (HCD, CID, ETD, EThCD, ETciD ) with ion trap or Orbitrap readout and HCD spectra were recorded at 6 different collision energies.	LC-MS runs were individually anaysed using MaxQuant 1.5.3.30.
