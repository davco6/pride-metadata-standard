MAGE-TAB Version	1.1
Investigation Title	Enterococcus faecalis biofilm proteome
Experiment Description	The biofilm proteome profile of endodontic and systemic pathogen E. faecalis has been analysed in this study to identify markers associated with its biofilm formation. Strong and weak biofilm forming E. faecalis clinical isolates were compared with two standard ATCC strains of E. faecalis in order to elucidate the biological pathways associated with the biofilm formation capability of E. faecalis.

Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	100 Âµg of biofilm proteins extracted from the four E. faecalis strains in duplicates were subjected to trypsin digestion and labelled with iTRAQ Reagent 8-plex kit (AB SCIEX). The samples were then acidified and subjected to strong cation-exchange chromatography to remove all interfering substances. The  eluted fractions eluted were desalted using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Water) followed by 2D LC-MS/MS analysis using 1290 Infinity LC system coupled with 1260 Fraction Collector.	Peptide identification and quantification was carried out on the ProteinPilot 5.0 software Revision 4769 (AB SCIEX) using the ParagonTM database search algorithm (5.0.0.0.4767) and the integrated false discovery rate (FDR) analysis function. The data were searched against a protein sequence database downloaded from UniProtKB for E. faecalis 29212. A strict unused confidence score of >1.3 corresponding to a peptide confidence level of 95% was used as the selection criteria for proteins.
