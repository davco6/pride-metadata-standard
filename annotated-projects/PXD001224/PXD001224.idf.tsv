Investigation Title	A High-resolution Systems-wide Screen for Substrates of the SCFβTrCP Ubiquitin Ligase - reproducibility evaluation
Experiment Description	This project demonstrates a combined bioinformatics and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) workflow for identifying in a systems-wide manner bone fide substrates of βTrCP

Date of Experiment	2014-08-14
Public Release Date	2015-01-06

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD001224	P-MTAB-Data-PXD001224
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	FLAG-HA-tandemly tagged βTrCP were expressed in the HEK203 cells. Following affinity purification (AP), proteins pulled down were digested and analysed with LC-MS/MS.	MaxQuant was used for identification and quantification of the pulled down proteins and validated with a FDR of 1%. The CRAPome and Perseus were used to compare the multiple samples for proteins that are significantly enriched in a particular sample
