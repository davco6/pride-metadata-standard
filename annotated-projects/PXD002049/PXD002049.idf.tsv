See associated protocols and methods documents at https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu.	Peptide identification employed the RefSeq Human protein sequence database using three different database search engines: myrimatch, pepitome and MS-GF+. Spectral identification files were converted to IDPicker SQLite databases (idpDB) using IDPicker 3. The resulting files were used for final protein assembly providing the minimal list of proteins that could explain the available peptides identified. Initially, spectrum-to-peptide match stringency was set at 0.1% FDR with a minimum of 2 distinct peptides identified per protein. The dataset was limited to the 7526 protein groups identified while spectral counts were increased by relaxing the spectrum-to-peptide match FDR to 1%. Assembly at the gene level resulted in the identification of 7211 gene groups for the full dataset. Variant peptide sequences were identified by separate database searches using data from RNA-seq of the individual carcinomas using the R package customProDB. A total of 796 single amino acid variants were identified.
