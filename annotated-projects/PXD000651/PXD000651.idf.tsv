Investigation Title	CSF proteome mapping: Human cerebrospinal fluid LC-MS/MS, Part 1
Experiment Description	3 mL CSF from a pool of 21 neurologically healthy donors was separated into a bound and a depleted fraction using a MARS Hu-14 column. This experiment represents the bound fraction. Gel separation on a gradient gel (SDS-PAGE) followed and the gel lane was cut into 37 fractions. Each fraction was in-gel trypsin digested and analyzed separately by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer. Resulting data was searched using SeachGui, summarized in PeptideShaker and exported to CSF-PR.
