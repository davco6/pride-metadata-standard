Investigation Title	Mapping the HLA ligandome of Colorectal Cancer Reveals an Imprint of Malignant Cell Transformation
Experiment Description	Immunopeptidome analysis of colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues as well as adjacent benign tissues was performed to characterize the natural HLA class I and class II presented ligandome represented in the context of malignancy as well as in benign tissue of the colon.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD009602	P-MTAB-Data-PXD009602
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	HLA class I and II molecules were isolated by standard immunoaffinity purification as described previously (Kowalewski et al. Methods Mol Biol. 2013;960:145-157.). Pan-HLA class I-specific mAb W6/32 (Barnstable et al. Cell. 1978;14(1):9-20.) was employed for HLA class I immunoprecipitation and pan-HLA class II mAb Tü39 (Ziegler et al. Immunobiology. 1986;171(1-2):77-92.) as well as HLA-DR-specific mAb L243 (Goldman et al. Br J Haematol. 1982;52(3):411-20.) were used for HLA class II immunoprecipitation and subsequently eluted using 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. Typically > 0.5 g of tissue samples were employed for lysis and HLA ligand isolation.	not applicable; raw data files are provides. Files are labelled according to identifiers (UPN) given in Supplementary table 3; Files are categorized according to assessed sample materials as CRC (colorectal adenocarcinoma; bulk tissue; malignant); NMT (colon; bulk tissue; non-malignant); Samples adjusted for label-free quantitation (LFQ) of relative HLA-ligand abundances in technical replicates and normalized according to the relative sample amounts in the respective ligand extracts, estimated based on the summed intensities of all peptide identifications detected in dose-finding mass spectrometry runs are labelled as REP#; samples measured previous to adjusting relative sample amounts in dose-finding mass spectrometry runs are labelled by PA (pre-adjustment); remaining sample material measured after measurement of technical replicates are labelled R(#) (remnant).
