Investigation Title	Proteomic analysis of human anterior pituitary gland
Experiment Description	The regulation of pituitary function via the hypothalamus and via intra-pituitary connections represents a complex system. Though hormones secreted from the pituitary glands have been well studied, overall information of proteins expressed in the pituitary glands is very limited. Protein expression profiling of normal pituitary tissue may lead to discovery of novel proteins playing an important role in the physiology of pituitary glands and can lead to better understanding of pituitary gland diseases. We aimed to carry out systematic proteomic profiling of adenohypophysis from human pituitary glands using high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometer. A total of 2,175 proteins were identified in this study of which, 105 proteins were identified for the first time as compared to high throughput proteomic-based studies from human pituitary glands. The comprehensive list of proteins identified in this study will facilitate the better understanding the role of this important gland in health and disease.

Protocol Description	Adenohypophysis tissues were collected from the Human Brain Tissue Repository (National Research Facility), NIMHANS, Bangalore, India. The tissues(n=3)were acquired from male victims who met with road traffic accidents. The tissues were individually subjected to homogenization in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle. Proteins were extracted using urea lysis buffer (9 M urea, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate and 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0) and subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C.Five hundred microgram of protein was pooled from each of 3adenohypophysis tissue lysates to obtain a final protein pool of 1.5 mg. Approximately, 300 μg aliquot from the protein pool was subjected to in-gel digestion while a 1 mg protein aliquot was subjected to in-solution digestion using trypsin protease. Peptides from gel bands were extracted and subjected to C18 stage tip clean up. bRPLC fractionation of 1 mg in-solution digested peptides were carried out separately on XBridge (C18, 5 μm 250 × 4.6 mm column) (Waters Corporation) that was coupled to an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system. A total of 96 fractions collected from 1 mg of in-solution digested peptides were further pooled to obtain a total of 12 fractions. The 12 bRPLC fractions and 21 in-gel peptide fractions were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis on LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer separately.	Mass spectrometry data was searched against NCBI Human RefSeq 81 database containing 110,386protein sequences. The data was analyzed on Proteome Discoverer platform, version 2.1 (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) that is interfaced with SequestHT and Mascot (Version 2.4) search algorithms. The search was carried out with precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm and fragment mass tolerance of 0.05 Da. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as static modification while oxidation of methionine was set as dynamic modifications. Acetylation of protein N-terminus was also enabled as dynamic modification to capture N-terminal peptides. Other search parameters included two missed cleavage by trypsin protease and 1% false discovery rate (FDR) at PSM level.
