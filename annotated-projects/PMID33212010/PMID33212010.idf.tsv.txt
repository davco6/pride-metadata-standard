Investigation Title	CPTAC Breast Cancer Confirmatory Study
Experiment Description	Tissue for this CPTAC study was collected and characterized for a confirmatory cohort of 125 individuals with breast cancer. Quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses were performed on breast tumors (125 participants) and adjacent normal breast tissue (18 participants). The analyses of this CPTAC cohort were conducted in order to more extensively characterize the proteogenomic landscape of breast cancer initially described in the publication by Mertins et al., (Nature 2016). Data were generated with TMT10plex quantification and each 10-plex experiment contained a common reference sample composed of a pooled mixture of 40 tumor samples. There are 17 global proteomic 10-plex datasets each with 25 fractions and 17 phosphoproteomic 10-plex datasets each with 13 fractions. Raw LC-MS/MS (level 1 data) provided below are from investigators at the Proteome Characterization Center located at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Raw data were processed through the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP) to produce peptide spectrum match reports (level 2 data) and protein summary reports (level 3 data).

Protocol Description	Cryopulverized human breast cancer patient tumor samples were homogenized in lysis buffer at a ratio of about 750 uL lysis buffer for every 100-125 mg wet weight tissue.  The lysis buffer consisted of 8 M urea, 75 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8), 10 mM NaF, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (1:100; Sigma, P5726) and cocktail 3 (1:100; Sigma, P0044), 2 µg/mL aprotinin (Sigma, A6103), 10 µg/mL Leupeptin (Roche, 11017101001), and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma, 78830). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 minutes and protein concentrations of the clarified lysates were measured by BCA assay (Pierce). Protein lysates were subsequently reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (Thermo Scientific, 20291) for 45 minutes at room temperature and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma, A3221) for 45 minutes in the dark. Prior to digestion, samples were diluted 4-fold to achieve 2 M urea with 50mM Tris HCl (pH 8). Digestion was performed with LysC (Wako, 100369-826) for 2 hours and with trypsin (Promega, V511X) overnight, both at a 1:50 enzyme-to-protein ratio and at room temperature. Digested samples were acidified with formic acid (FA; Fluka, 56302) to achieve a final volumetric concentration of 1 % (final pH of ~3), and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 minutes to clear precipitated urea from peptide lysates. Samples were desalted on C18 SepPak columns (Waters, 100mg, WAT036820) and dried down using a SpeedVac apparatus.400 ug of desalted peptides per sample (based on protein-level BCA prior to digestion) were labeled with 10-plex TMT reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Scientific; Pierce Biotechnology, Germany). For each 400 ug peptide aliquot of an individual breast tumor sample, 3.2 mg of labeling reagent was used. Peptides were dissolved in 400 μL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) solution and labeling reagent was added in 164 μL of acetonitrile. After 1 h incubation with shaking and after confirming good label incorporation, 32 uL of 5% hydroxylamine was added to quench the unreacted TMT reagents. Good label incorporation was defined as having a minimum of 95% fully labeled MS/MS spectra in each sample, as measured by LC-MS/MS after taking out a 2 µg aliquot from each sample and analyzing 1µg.  If a sample did not have sufficient label incorporation, additional TMT was added to the sample and another 1 h incubation was performed with shaking.  At the time that the labeling efficiency quality control samples were taken out, an additional 2 µg of material from each sample was taken out and combined as a mixing control.  After analyzing the mixing control sample by LC-MS/MS, intensity values of the individual TMT reporter ions were summed across all peptide spectrum matches and compared to ensure that the total reporter ion intensity of each sample met a threshold of +/- 25% of the internal reference.  If necessary, adjustments were made by either labeling additional material or reducing an individual sample’s contribution to the mixture, and analyzing a subsequent mixing control, until all samples met the threshold and were thus approximately 1:1:1....  Differentially labeled peptides were then mixed (10 x 400 ug), dried down via vacuum centrifuge, and the quenched, combined sample was subsequently desalted on a 500 mg C18 SepPak column.To reduce sample complexity, peptide samples were separated by high pH reversed phase (RP) separation as described prior. A desalted 4 mg, 10-plex TMT-labeled experiment (based on protein-level BCA prior to digestion) was reconstituted in 900 µL 0.0455% ammonium formate (pH 10) and 2% acetonitrile, loaded on a 4.6 mm x 250 mm column RP Zorbax 300 A Extend-C18 column (Agilent, 3.5 µm bead size), and separated on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC instrument using basic reversed-phase chromatography. Solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 4.4 mM ammonium formate, pH 10) and a nonlinear increasing concentration of solvent B (90% acetonitrile, 4.5 mM ammonium formate, pH 10) were used to separate peptides. The 4.5 mM ammonium formate solvents were made by 40–fold dilution of a stock solution of 180 mM ammonium formate, pH 10. To make 200 ml of stock solution, slowly add 4.6 mL of 30% (wt/vol) ammonium hydroxide (Ammonia solution 28.0-30.0% (NH₃ basis) ACS, 0.9 g/ml, Fluka) to ~150mL of HPLC grade water, then titrate to pH 10.0 with ~9.0 mL of concentrated formic acid (>95% Sigma-Aldrich); bring to final volume of 200 mL with HPLC grade water. The 96 minute separation LC gradient followed this profile: (min: %B) 0:0; 7:0; 13:16; 73:40; 77:44; 82:60; 96:60.  The flow rate was 1 mL/min. Per 4 mg separation, 77 fractions were collected into a 96 deep-well x 2mL plate (Whatman, #7701- 5200), with fractions combined in a step-wise concatenation strategy and acidified to a final concentration of 0.1% FA as reported previously.  An additional 12 fractions were collected from the 96 deep-well plate for fraction A, which are the early eluting fractions that tend to contain multi-phosphorylated peptides.  5% of the volume of each of the 24+A proteome fractions was allocated for proteome analysis, dried down, and re-suspended in 3% MeCN/0.1% FA (MeCN; acetonitrile) to a peptide concentration of 0.5 µg/uL for LC-MS/MS analysis. The remaining 95% of concatenated 24 fractions were further combined into 12 fractions, with fraction A as a separate fraction.  These 13 fractions were then enriched for phosphopeptides as described below.Online separation was done with a nanoflow Proxeon EASY-nLC 1200 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) In this set up, the LC system, column, and platinum wire used to deliver electrospray source voltage were connected via a stainless-steel cross (360μm, IDEX Health & Science, UH-906x). The column was heated to 50°C using a column heater sleeve (Phoenix-ST) to prevent over-pressuring of columns during UHPLC separation. Each peptide fraction, ~1ug (based on protein-level BCA prior to digestion with uniformly-distributed fractionation presumed), the equivalent of 12% of each global proteome sample in a 2 ul injection volume, or 50% of each phosphoproteome sample in a 4 ul injection volume, was injected onto an in-house packed 20cm x 75um diameter C18 silica picofrit capillary column (1.9 μm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ beads, Dr. Maisch GmbH, r119.aq; Picofrit 10um tip opening, New Objective, PF360-75-10-N-5). Mobile phase flow rate was 200 nL/min, comprised of 3% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (Solvent A) and 90% acetonitrile /0.1% formic acid (Solvent B). The 110-minute LC-MS/MS method consisted of a 10-min column-equilibration procedure; a 20-min sample-loading procedure; and the following gradient profile: (min:%B) 0:2; 1:6; 85:30; 94:60; 95;90; 100:90; 101:50; 110:50 (the last two steps at 500 nL/min flow rate).Samples were analyzed with a benchtop Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a NanoSpray Flex NG ion source Data-dependent acquisition was performed using Xcalibur QExactive v2.1 software in positive ion mode at a spray voltage of 1.8 kV. MS1 Spectra were measured with a resolution of 60,000, an AGC target of 4e5 and a mass range from 350 to 1800 m/z. The data-dependent mode cycle time was set at 2 seconds with a MS2 resolution of 50,000, an AGC target of 1e5, an isolation window of 0.7 m/z, a maximum injection time of 105 msec, and an HCD collision energy of 38%. Peptide mode was selected for monoisotopic peak determination, and charge state screening was enabled to only include precursor charge states 2-6, with an intensity threshold of 1e4. Peptides that triggered MS/MS scans were dynamically excluded from further MS/MS scans for 45 sec, with a +/- 10 ppm mass tolerance. Perform dependent scan on single charge state per precursor only was enabled.	Raw data were processed through the CPTAC Common Data Analysis Pipeline (CDAP) to produce peptide spectrum match reports (level 2 data) and protein summary reports (level 3 data)
