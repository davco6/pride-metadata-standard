Investigation Title	Protein variability in cerebrospinal fluid and its possible implications for neurological protein biomarker research
Experiment Description	Investigation of inter- and intraindividual variability of the cerebrospinal fluid proteome globally and with a specific focus on disease biomarkers described in literature of neurologically unimpaired healthy controls. For further studies we calculated for all proteins a reference change value (RCV).

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD007555	P-MTAB-Data-PXD007555
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	CSF was obtained from the subarachnoid space of the lumbar spinal cord by lumbar puncture of 12 neurologically unimpaired healthy controls at three points in time. CSF was centrifuged and supernatant was taken for tryptic digestion. Peptids were analyzed on a nanoHPLC system coupled on-line to quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer.	Mass spectrometric data were analyzed with the intensity based quantification software MaxQuant. The coefficient of variation (CV) as well as the reference change value (RCV) was calculated between subjects and between different points in time within subjects.
