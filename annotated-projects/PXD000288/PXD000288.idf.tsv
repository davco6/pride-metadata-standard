Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	SDS lysate from skeletal muscle and C2C12 cells were digested using trypsin on FASP filters. Peptides  were fractionated using OFF GEL fractionator. Peptides were purified, separated  50 CM column (C18) and measured on Q Exactive mass spectrometer.	MS files were analyzed by MaxQuant version 1.3.7.4. Inbuilt Andromeda search precursor mass and fragment mass were identified with an initial mass tolerance of 6 ppm and 20 ppm respectively. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids. FDR for proteins and peptide identification was set to 0.01. MS runs were analyzed with or without 'match between runs' options.
