Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD006132	P-MTAB-Data-PXD006132
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	FFPE samples from LSCC, FASP protein digestion, LC-MS/MS protein label-free quantification using orbitrap Fusion	raw data was processed using Progenesis QI for Proteomics. The created mgf was searched using Mascot Search engine. Mascot.dat file was imported in Scaffold for protein grouping. Identification results were imported in Progenesis for quantification.
