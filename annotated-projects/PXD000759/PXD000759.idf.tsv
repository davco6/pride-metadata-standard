Investigation Title	Phosphopeptide enrichment on synthetic libraries and HeLa cells digest
Experiment Description	2 phosphopeptide enrichment methods (TiO2 and Ti-IMAC) were evaluated on synthetic libraries and HeLa cells digest. The resulting peptides were compared to the ones without enrichment with regards to the nature of the phosphorylation site (serine, threonine, tyrosine) and the characteristics of the peptide enriched. It was found that the enrichment methods are unbiased for these properties and that the result of the enrichment reflects the original condition of the sample.

Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	Peptides from synthetic libraries of HeLa cells digests were enriched with TiO2 or TiO2. Samples before and after enrichment were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Elite with a data dependent decision tree method combining CID and ETD fragmention.	The resulting spectra were searched with Proteome Discoverer, Mascot as a search engine and phosphoRS as a localization tool. PSMs were filtered according to several criteria (rank 1, Mascot delta score, Mascot score, localization score, known sequence information for the library peptides) and then grouped into peptide sequences. An area was calculated as the median of the PSMs area.
