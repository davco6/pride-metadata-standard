Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	Frozen tissue slices were lysed with 6 M urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer for protein extraction. Urea was removed from the samples using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters. Reduced and alkylated proteins were digested with trypsin in a ratio 1:100 w/w (trypsin:protein) overnight at 37Â°C. LC-MS/MS was performed with a Thermo Easy nLC 1000 system coupled online to a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer.	Raw files were analysed with Proteome Discoverer v 2.1. Peptides were identified using SEQUEST HT against UniProtKB human database integrated into Proteome Discoverer (release May 2016). The search was performed with the following parameters applied: carbamidomethylation as static modification, oxidation of methionine as dynamic modification, 20 ppm precursor tolerance and 0.02 Da fragment tolerance. Up to two missed cleavages for tryptic peptides was allowed. Filters: high confidence at peptides and protein levels were applied (FDR 0.01). We have used unsupervised and supervised approaches to linking proteomic data to survival. The unsupervised method was performed using consensus clustering in R using ConsensusClusterPlus library (version 1.42.0). The supervised approach is based on PLS-Cox regression similar to that of [1].
