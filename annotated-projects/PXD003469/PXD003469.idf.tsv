Investigation Title	Functional Proteogenomics Reveals Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Lymphomas
Experiment Description	The proteomic and posttranslational modification signatures of most cancers are unknown. N-linked glycosylation is a post-translational modification that targets proteins for membrane expression or secretion making this class of proteins attractive cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Using an unbiased mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach we generated a compendium of 1,155 N-linked glycoproteins (2,160 N-glycosites) from 44 human primary lymphomas and malignant lymphoma cell lines. Hierarchical clustering highlighted distinct subtype signatures which included several novel subtype-specific biomarkers. Orthogonal immunologic studies in 671 primary lymphoma tissue biopsies, 36 lymphoma-derived cell lines or 8 patient-derived circulating tumor cell samples corroborated MS-based glycoproteomic data and authenticated selected proteins as tissue biomarkers. Functional targeting using a toxin-conjugated ligand in vitro and RNAi-mediated silencing targeting subtype-specific glycoproteins abrogated lymphoma growth in vivo. Our results demonstrate the utility of global N-glycoproteomics discovery of cancer biomarkers and targets for precision therapeutics.

Protocol Description	Solid phase extraction of glycoproteins/peptides (SPEG) protocol previously described was used to isolate N-glycosylated peptides from whole cell lysates. Briefly, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (8.0 M urea, 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0). Five mg total protein were treated with TCEP (10 mM, 60 C, 1 h) to reduce cysteine and the free sulfhydryl groups were alklyated using iodoacetamide (12 mM, RT, 30 min). Upon reducing the urea concentration to less than 2 M with phosphate buffer, proteins were digested overnight with sequencing grade, modified trypsin (1:50), at 37 C. Peptides were desalted using a SepPak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp), and carbohydrate moieties oxidized with sodium periodate (10mM, 4 C, 1 h). Unreacted sodium periodate and buffer components are exchanged once again using a SepPak plus C18 cartridge. Oxidized glycopeptides peptides were then coupled to Affi-Gel Hz hydrazide resin (Bio-Rad) overnight with constant mixing. Resin was washed with dimethylformamide, water and 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Bound N-glycopeptides were released by incubating the resin with PNGase F (15,000 U, New England Biolabs) at 37 C for 4 h. Supernatant was collected and the hydrazide resin is washed twice with ammonium bicarbonate buffer. All washes were combined with the supernatant. Deglycosylated peptides were desalted using a SepPak C18 cartridge. The eluate was dried and resolubilized in 40 µl of loading buffer (0.1% TFA/2% ACN).LTQ OrbitrapXL (ThermoFisher) in-line with Paradigm MS2 HPLC (Michrom BioResources, Inc.) was employed for acquiring high-resolution MS and MS/MS data. Dried peptides were reconstituted in 35 μl of sample loading buffer. Ten μl was loaded onto a sample trap (Captrap, Bruker-Michrom) in-line with nano-capillary column (Picofrit, 75 μm i.d.x 15 μm tip, New Objective) packed in-house with 10 cm of MAGIC AQ C18 reverse phase material. Peptides were eluted using an acetonitrile/1% acetic acid gradient system (5-50% acetonitrile/1% acetic acid in 75 min and 10 min wash with 95% acetonitrile/1% acetic acid followed by 30 min of re-equilibration with 2% acetonitrile/1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of ~0.3 μl/min.	Peptides were directly introduced into the mass spectrometer using a nano-spray source. Orbitrap was set to collect 1 survey scan between 400-2000 m/z (resolution of 30,000 @ 400 m/z) in Orbitrap followed by data dependent CID spectra on top 9 ions in LTQ (normalized collision energy ~35%). Dynamic exclusion was set to 2 MS/MS acquisition followed by exclusion of the same precursor ion for further 2 min. Maximum ion injection times were set to 300 ms for MS and 100 ms for MS/MS. Automatic Gain Control (AGC) was set to 1xe6 for MS and 5000 for MS/MS. Charge state screening was enabled to discard +1 and unassigned charge states. Technical triplicate data were acquired on each sample. Each cell line was analyzed in biological replicate format until at least 3 biological replicates with a glycocapture efficiency of ≥90%, defined as percentage of identified peptides having at least one deamidated Asn residue, were obtained. RAW files were converted to mzXML using ReAdW conversion tool from the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) then searched against the human UniProt database (release 15.15) concatenated with common contaminants. Reverse sequences of these proteins were also appended to the database as decoys. Searches were carried out using X!Tandem with k score plugin. Search parameters were as follows: 1) precursor parent and daughter ion mass tolerance window was set to 50 ppm and 0.8 Da respectively; 2) maximum of 2 missed cleavages; 3) variable modifications: oxidized methionine (+15.9949 Da), carbamidomethyl cysteine (+57.0214 Da) and +0.9840 Da on Asn (reflecting conversion of glycosylated Asn to Asp upon PNGaseF mediated deglycosylation). X!Tandem results were post-processed using PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet.
