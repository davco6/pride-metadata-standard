Investigation Title	Quantitative proteome analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue
Experiment Description	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive tumors and the treatment outcome of this disease is improved when the cancer is diagnosed at early stages. This requires biomarkers allowing for an accurate and early tumor diagnosis. To identify potential markers for such applications we performed a label-free proteome analysis using samples collected from 19 patients. We analyzed the data considering events known to take place in early events of HCC development such as abnormal regulation of Wnt/b-catenin and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We expected that such analysis can lead to the identification of potential biomarkers for early-stage HCC diagnosis. 31 proteins functionally linked to downstream interactors of Wnt/b-catenin and parts of RTKs´-activated pathways Ras and JAK/STAT were selected for verification in a larger and independent cohort (n= 31) using selected (multiple) reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM).

Protocol Description	HCC and corresponding non-tumorous tissue samples were collected from 50 primary liver cancer patients following hepatic resection or liver transplantation.After collection, the samples were snap-frozen and stored at -80°C till analysis. Tissue samples were lysed and homogenized in sample buffer (30 mM Tris, 7 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.5) and the protein concentration was determined using Bradford assay.10 µg of protein from tissue lysate were run into 18% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel (Anamed Elektrophorese, Germany) for about 1 cm (15 min. and 100V). After Coomassie staining, gels pieces were excised and tryptically digested with 1:50 ratio (enzyme to protein) over night at 37°C. The resulted peptides were then extracted from the gel by 15 min sonication on ice using 20 µl of 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) twice. The peptides were dried via vacuum centrifugation and dissolved in 0.1% TFA. The peptide concentration was determined by amino acid analysis performed on an ACQUITY-UPLC equipped with AccQ Tag Ultra-UPLC column (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) calibrated with Pierce Amino Acid Standard (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany).	Ion intensity-based label-free quantification was carried out using Progenesis LC-MS software (ver. 4.1.4832.42146, Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd., Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The retention times of eluting peptides from all the samples within the experiment were aligned to the selected reference run. Only features with charges from +2 to +4 were included for later analysis. Features with two or less isotopic peaks were excluded. After the alignment and feature filtering, the raw abundances of all features were normalized to correct the experimental variations. Search results from Proteome Discoverer were imported into Progenesis LC-MS in order to combine peptide quantification and identification. Only unique peptides for a corresponding protein were used for quantification. The protein grouping option integrated in Progenesis LC-MS was disabled.
