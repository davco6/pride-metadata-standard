Investigation Title	Proteome analyses of the human anterior temporal lobe
Experiment Description	Characterization of the human Anterior Temporal Lobe and Corpus Callosum: C-HPP

Date of Experiment	2014-06-05
Public Release Date	2014-06-05

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD000548	P-MTAB-Data-PXD000548
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	Protein samples extracted from human brains in 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea,4% CHAPS, 2% ASB-14, and 70 mM DTT. Proteins were pre-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and submitted to in-gel digestion. Peptides were separated in a nano HPLC, coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer.	Mass spectra were extracted in the MS2 format using the PatternLab for Proteomics RawReader employing the NeXtProt database.
