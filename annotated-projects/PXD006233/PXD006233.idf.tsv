Investigation Title	uDPMs in AD+CVD -  Brain ureido degenerative protein modifications are associated with neuroinflammation and proteinopathy in Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular disease
Experiment Description	In this study we have profiled the temporal lobe proteome of AD+CVD subjects and age-matched controls. We have studied the occurrence of uDPMs in the particulate and soluble brain proteomes isolated and analyzed by ultracentrifugation-electrostatic repulsion hydrophilic interaction chromatography (UC-ERLIC).

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD006233	P-MTAB-Data-PXD006233
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	Soluble and brain proteomes were isolated as previously reported by UC-ERLIC and solubilized in different concentrartions of SDC. In-solution digestion was then performed and the proteomes were digested with trypsin.	Database search was performed using PEAKS PTMs 7.5.
