Investigation Title	Shotgun proteomics of Vero E6 cells infected by Italy-INMI1 SARS-CoV-2 virus
Experiment Description	Next-generation proteomics of Vero E6 cells infected by Italy-INMI1 SARS-CoV-2 virus for defining the kinetics of whole viral particle antigen production for vaccines. Cells from Day1, Day2, Day3, Day4, Day7 post-infection at two multiplicities of infection.

Date of Experiment	2020-06-03
Public Release Date	2020-06-03

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD018594	P-MTAB-Data-PXD018594
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	After virus heat inactivation, proteins were extracted. Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.	MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed and protein abundances were compared by spectral counts.
Protocol Parameters
Protocol Hardware	Q Exactive HF
Protocol Software		Mascot Parser 2.5.2.0;Mascot Server 2.5.1
